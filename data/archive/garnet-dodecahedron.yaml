description: >
  Pure rhombic dodecahedral habit - the most common crystal form for garnets.
  The dodecahedron {110} displays twelve rhomb-shaped faces meeting at
  identical angles. This habit is particularly common in almandine and
  pyrope garnets, often showing slightly curved face striations.
