description: >
  Cyclic pseudohexagonal twin composed of three orthorhombic individuals
  rotated 120 degrees to create apparent hexagonal symmetry. Trillings
  form characteristically flat, hexagonal-looking crystals with prominent
  re-entrant angles at the twin boundaries. This twin habit is extremely
  common in chrysoberyl and helps identify the species.
