cdl: monoclinic[2/m]:{100}@1.0 + {001}@0.8 + {010}@0.7 + {110}@0.5
system: monoclinic
point_group: 2/m
chemistry: Ca2(Al,Fe)3(SiO4)3(OH)
hardness: 6-7
description: >
  Calcium-aluminum-iron silicate forming elongated prismatic crystals,
  typically striated parallel to the b-axis. Epidote displays a distinctive
  pistachio to yellowish-green color (the "epidote green") and is strongly
  pleochroic. While occasionally faceted as a collector gem, its perfect
  cleavage and strong pleochroism make cutting challenging.
