  form_description: 'Calcium-aluminum-iron silicate forming elongated prismatic crystals, typically striated
    parallel to the b-axis. Epidote displays a distinctive pistachio to yellowish-green color (the "epidote
    green") and is strongly pleochroic. While occasionally faceted as a collector gem, its perfect cleavage
    and strong pleochroism make cutting challenging.

  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  note: Variable birefringence depending on iron content; high relief in thin section
