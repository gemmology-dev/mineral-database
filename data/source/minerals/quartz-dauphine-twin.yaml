description: >
  Penetration twin with 180 degree rotation about the c-axis (trigonal axis).
  Dauphine twinning involves interpenetration of two right-handed or two
  left-handed quartz individuals, resulting in domains with opposite
  orientation of prism faces. Often detectable only under polarized light
  or by etching. Named for the Dauphine region of France.
