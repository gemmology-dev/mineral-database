  form_description: 'Yellow to golden variety of beryl, coloured by iron (Fe3+). The name derives from
    Greek "helios" (sun) and "doron" (gift). Heliodor typically forms elongated prismatic crystals and
    is valued for its warm golden hues. Sometimes confused with yellow sapphire or citrine due to similar
    coloration.
