  Trapezohedron (icositetrahedron) habit displaying 24 kite-shaped faces.
  This form {211} is more commonly seen in grossular and andradite garnets
  than in the pyralspite series. Often occurs in combination with
  dodecahedral faces in natural specimens. Classic examples from Alpine
  localities and Italian grossulars.
