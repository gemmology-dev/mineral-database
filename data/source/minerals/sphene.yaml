  form_description: 'Calcium titanium silicate forming characteristic wedge or envelope-shaped crystals
    (Greek "sphenos" = wedge). Sphene possesses the highest dispersion of any common gemstone (0.051),
    exceeding even diamond (0.044), producing exceptional fire in well-cut stones. Combined with strong
    pleochroism and high birefringence, sphene displays remarkable optical effects but is challenging
    to cut due to its softness and distinct cleavage.

    '
  forms:
  - wedge (characteristic)
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  note: Dispersion exceeds diamond; high birefringence causes visible facet doubling; too soft for everyday
    wear
