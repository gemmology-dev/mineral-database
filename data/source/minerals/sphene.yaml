cdl: monoclinic[2/m]:{100}@1.0 + {110}@0.6 + {111}@0.5 + {001}@0.3
system: monoclinic
point_group: 2/m
chemistry: CaTiSiO5
hardness: 5-5.5
description: >
  Calcium titanium silicate forming characteristic wedge or envelope-shaped
  crystals (Greek "sphenos" = wedge). Sphene possesses the highest dispersion
  of any common gemstone (0.051), exceeding even diamond (0.044), producing
  exceptional fire in well-cut stones. Combined with strong pleochroism and
  high birefringence, sphene displays remarkable optical effects but is
  challenging to cut due to its softness and distinct cleavage.

sg: 3.52-3.54
ri: 1.900-2.034
birefringence: 0.100-0.160
optical_character: Biaxial +
pleochroism: Strong trichroic (colorless/yellow, green/orange, red/brown)
pleochroism_strength: very_strong
pleochroism_color1: Colorless/Yellow
pleochroism_color2: Green/Orange
pleochroism_color3: Red/Brown
pleochroism_notes: Strongly trichroic; combined with high dispersion creates complex optical effects
dispersion: 0.051
lustre: Adamantine to resinous
cleavage: Distinct {110}
fracture: Subconchoidal
note: Dispersion exceeds diamond; high birefringence causes visible facet doubling; too soft for everyday wear
