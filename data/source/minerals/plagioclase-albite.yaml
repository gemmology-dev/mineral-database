name: Plagioclase (Albite Twin)
cdl: triclinic[-1]:{010}@1.0 + {001}@0.8 + {100}@0.5 + {110}@0.4 | twin(albite)
system: triclinic
point_group: '-1'
chemistry: (Na,Ca)(Al,Si)4O8
hardness: 6-6.5
description: >
  Polysynthetic lamellar twinning on {010}, the most common twinning in
  plagioclase feldspars. Albite law twins form parallel sets of thin lamellae
  that create characteristic striations visible on crystal faces and cleavage
  surfaces. These striations are a key diagnostic feature for identifying
  plagioclase. The composition plane is {010} with twin axis perpendicular to it.

optical_character: Biaxial + or -
pleochroism: None to weak
lustre: Vitreous to pearly
cleavage: Perfect in two directions at approximately 90 degrees

note: Albite twinning striations visible on {010} cleavage distinguish plagioclase from orthoclase
