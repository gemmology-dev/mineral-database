  form_description: 'Polysynthetic lamellar twinning on {010}, the most common twinning in plagioclase
    feldspars. Albite law twins form parallel sets of thin lamellae that create characteristic striations
    visible on crystal faces and cleavage surfaces. These striations are a key diagnostic feature for
    identifying plagioclase. The composition plane is {010} with twin axis perpendicular to it.

    '
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - twin
  note: Albite twinning striations visible on {010} cleavage distinguish plagioclase from orthoclase
