description: >
  Bi-colored tourmaline variety displaying a pink core surrounded by a green
  rim (or occasionally the reverse), resembling a watermelon slice in cross-
  section. The color zoning results from compositional changes during crystal
  growth, typically involving variations in manganese and iron content. Prized
  for slices cut perpendicular to the c-axis showing the characteristic zoning.
