  form_description: 'Blue feldspathoid mineral, a member of the sodalite group. Unlike lapis lazuli (which
    contains lazurite), sodalite typically displays a more uniform royal blue color often with white calcite
    veining. Almost always occurs as massive aggregates. Hackmanite, a sulfur-rich variety, exhibits
    remarkable tenebrescence (reversible photochromism).'
  forms:
  - massive
  note: Distinguished from lapis lazuli by absence of pyrite and uniform color; hackmanite shows photochromism

  is_primary: false
  form_description: 'Well-formed dodecahedral crystals of sodalite are rare. When found, they show
    rhombic dodecahedron habit with minor cube truncation. Most gem-quality sodalite is massive material.'
  forms:
  - dodecahedron
  - cube
  note: Well-formed crystals uncommon; sodalite usually occurs as massive aggregates
