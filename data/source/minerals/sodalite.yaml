  form_description: 'Blue feldspathoid mineral, a member of the sodalite group. Unlike lapis lazuli (which
    contains lazurite), sodalite typically displays a more uniform royal blue color often with white calcite
    veining. Well-formed crystals are rare - sodalite usually occurs as massive aggregates. Hackmanite,
    a sulfur-rich variety, exhibits remarkable tenebrescence.

    '
  forms:
  - dodecahedron
  - cube
  note: Distinguished from lapis lazuli by absence of pyrite and uniform color; hackmanite shows photochromism
