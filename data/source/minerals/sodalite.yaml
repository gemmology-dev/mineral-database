description: >
  Blue feldspathoid mineral, a member of the sodalite group. Unlike lapis
  lazuli (which contains lazurite), sodalite typically displays a more
  uniform royal blue color often with white calcite veining. Well-formed
  crystals are rare - sodalite usually occurs as massive aggregates.
  Hackmanite, a sulfur-rich variety, exhibits remarkable tenebrescence.
