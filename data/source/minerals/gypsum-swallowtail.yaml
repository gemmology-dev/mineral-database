description: >
  Contact twin on {100} creating the distinctive swallowtail or fishtail
  shape - one of the most recognizable twin forms in mineralogy. The
  re-entrant angle between the two individuals creates the characteristic
  notched appearance. Swallowtail gypsum twins are common in evaporite
  deposits and are prized by mineral collectors.
