name: Galena
cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@0.3
system: cubic
point_group: m3m
chemistry: PbS
hardness: 2.5
description: >
  Lead sulfide mineral displaying perfect cubic cleavage - the type example
  of cubic cleavage in mineralogy. Galena has a brilliant metallic lustre
  when fresh but tarnishes to dull grey. It is the primary ore of lead and
  an important source of silver. The combination of high density, perfect
  cleavage, and metallic lustre makes it easily identifiable.
