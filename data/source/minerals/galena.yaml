  form_description: 'Lead sulfide mineral displaying perfect cubic cleavage - the type example of cubic
    cleavage in mineralogy. Galena has a brilliant metallic lustre when fresh but tarnishes to dull grey.
    It is the primary ore of lead and an important source of silver. The combination of high density,
    perfect cleavage, and metallic lustre makes it easily identifiable.
