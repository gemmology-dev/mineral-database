description: >
  Optical twinning involving interpenetration of left-handed and right-handed
  quartz individuals - essentially a mirror twin. Brazil Law twins show
  opposite optical rotation in alternating domains, detectable with polarized
  light as sectors of different optical handedness. Not visible externally
  but affects optical properties significantly. Common in natural quartz.
