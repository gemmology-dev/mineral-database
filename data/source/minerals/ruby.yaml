  form_description: 'Star ruby displaying six-rayed asterism caused by dense, oriented rutile silk.
    Three sets of rutile needles intersect at 60 degrees within the basal plane, creating a six-pointed
    star visible when the stone is cut en cabochon. The finest star rubies from Myanmar show a sharp,
    well-centred star floating above a rich red bodycolour.'
