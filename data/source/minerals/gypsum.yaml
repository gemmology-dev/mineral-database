  form_description: 'Hydrated calcium sulfate - one of the softest minerals used as a hardness standard.
    Gypsum forms large tabular crystals, often with characteristic swallowtail twinning. The giant gypsum
    crystals of the Naica Mine in Mexico (up to 12 meters long) are among the largest crystals ever found.
    Varieties include transparent selenite, fibrous satin spar, and fine- grained alabaster.

  form_description: 'Contact twin on {100} creating the distinctive swallowtail or fishtail shape - one
    of the most recognizable twin forms in mineralogy. The re-entrant angle between the two individuals
    creates the characteristic notched appearance. Swallowtail gypsum twins are common in evaporite deposits
    and are prized by mineral collectors.
