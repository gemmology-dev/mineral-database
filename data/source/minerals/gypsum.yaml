description: >
  Hydrated calcium sulfate - one of the softest minerals used as a hardness
  standard. Gypsum forms large tabular crystals, often with characteristic
  swallowtail twinning. The giant gypsum crystals of the Naica Mine in
  Mexico (up to 12 meters long) are among the largest crystals ever found.
  Varieties include transparent selenite, fibrous satin spar, and fine-
  grained alabaster.
