  form_description: 'Manganese carbonate mineral prized for its rose-pink to deep red color. The "Alma
    King" from Colorado''s Sweet Home Mine is considered one of the finest mineral specimens ever found.
    Well-formed rhombohedral crystals are highly sought but rare.'
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  - scalenohedron
  note: Extremely high birefringence; dissolves in warm dilute HCl with effervescence; too soft for ring
    use

  form_description: 'Banded massive rhodochrosite — the most common presentation, displaying attractive
    concentric pink and white banding. Argentina produces the distinctive "Rosa del Inca" banded material
    formed in colonial-era Inca silver mines. Often fashioned into cabochons, beads, and decorative objects.'
  forms:
  - mammillary
  - banded masses
  note: Argentine banded material ("Rosa del Inca") formed in historic Inca silver mines
