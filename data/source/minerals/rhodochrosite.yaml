description: >
  Manganese carbonate mineral prized for its rose-pink to deep red color.
  The "Alma King" from Colorado's Sweet Home Mine is considered one of the
  finest mineral specimens ever found. Well-formed rhombohedral crystals are
  highly sought, but rhodochrosite also occurs in attractive banded massive
  form. Argentina produces distinctive banded material formed in Inca silver
  mines ("Rosa del Inca").
