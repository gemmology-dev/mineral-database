  form_description: 'Manganese carbonate mineral prized for its rose-pink to deep red color. The "Alma
    King" from Colorado''s Sweet Home Mine is considered one of the finest mineral specimens ever found.
    Well-formed rhombohedral crystals are highly sought, but rhodochrosite also occurs in attractive banded
    massive form. Argentina produces distinctive banded material formed in Inca silver mines ("Rosa del
    Inca").

    '
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  - scalenohedron
  - banded masses
  note: Extremely high birefringence; dissolves in warm dilute HCl with effervescence; too soft for ring
    use
