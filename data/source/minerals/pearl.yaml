  form_description: 'Organic gem produced by mollusks, composed of concentric layers of aragonite (calcium
    carbonate) crystals bound by conchiolin protein. The characteristic lustre (orient) results from light
    interference in the nacre layers. Natural pearls form around irritants; cultured pearls are nucleated
    intentionally. Pearls are layered aggregates without external crystal faces.'
  forms:
  - mammillary
  - concentric layers
  note: Organic gem — layered nacre aggregate, not a single crystal

  form_description: 'Aragonite crystal — the mineral component of nacre. Individual aragonite crystals
    are orthorhombic but in pearls they form as sub-micrometre platelets arranged in concentric layers
    with conchiolin protein matrix. This visualization represents the crystal form of aragonite, not the
    morphology of a pearl.'
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  note: Aragonite crystal form — not pearl morphology; pearls are layered nacre aggregates
