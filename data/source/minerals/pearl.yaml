name: Pearl
cdl: orthorhombic[mmm]:{110}@1.0 + {011}@0.7 + {101}@0.6
system: orthorhombic
point_group: mmm
chemistry: CaCO3 (aragonite) + conchiolin
hardness: 2.5-4.5
description: >
  Organic gem produced by mollusks, composed of concentric layers of aragonite
  (calcium carbonate) crystals bound by conchiolin protein. The characteristic
  lustre (orient) results from light interference in the nacre layers.
  Natural pearls form around irritants; cultured pearls are nucleated
  intentionally. This visualization represents aragonite - actual pearls are
  layered aggregates without external crystal faces.
