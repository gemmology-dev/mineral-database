  form_description: 'Organic gem produced by mollusks, composed of concentric layers of aragonite (calcium
    carbonate) crystals bound by conchiolin protein. The characteristic lustre (orient) results from light
    interference in the nacre layers. Natural pearls form around irritants; cultured pearls are nucleated
    intentionally. This visualization represents aragonite - actual pearls are layered aggregates without
    external crystal faces.

  - drop
  - concentric layers
  note: Organic gem; visualization shows aragonite crystal - actual pearls are layered nacre without crystal
    faces
