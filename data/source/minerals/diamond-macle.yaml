description: >
  Flattened triangular twin on {111}, also called "macle" - a spinel-law
  contact twin resulting in a distinctive triangular or slightly heart-shaped
  outline. Macles are historically significant in diamond cutting as their
  shape and twin plane orientation require specialized sawing techniques.
  Common in South African and Russian deposits.
