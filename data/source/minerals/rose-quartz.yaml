  is_primary: true
  form_description: Rose quartz in its characteristic massive habit — rarely forms discrete crystals. Pink colour from trace phosphorus and aluminium creating colour centres, or from fibrous dumortierite inclusions.
  forms:
  - massive
- slug: star
  name: Star Rose Quartz
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Rose Quartz (Star)
    #! System: Trigonal (32)
    #! Habit: Massive with asterism from rutile silk
    amorphous[cryptocrystalline]:{massive} | phenomenon[asterism:six_ray]
  form_description: Star rose quartz displaying six-rayed asterism when cut en cabochon, caused by oriented rutile needle inclusions following the trigonal symmetry.
  forms:
  - massive
  note: Six-rayed star from oriented rutile needles; best in transmitted light
