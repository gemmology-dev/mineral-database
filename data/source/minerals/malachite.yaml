  form_description: 'Copper carbonate hydroxide mineral displaying vivid green color and characteristic
    banded patterns when cut and polished. Almost always occurs in botryoidal, stalactitic, or banded
    massive forms. The banding results from variations in growth conditions creating alternating light
    and dark green layers. Historically important as a copper ore and ornamental stone.'
  forms:
  - botryoidal
  - mammillary
  - banded masses
  note: Reacts with dilute HCl (effervescence); often found with azurite

  form_description: 'Well-formed prismatic crystals of malachite are extremely rare and highly prized
    by collectors. When found, they typically show short prismatic habit with multiple pinacoid and prism
    faces. Crystal specimens command high premiums over massive material.'
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  note: Crystal specimens extremely rare and valuable; vast majority of malachite is massive/botryoidal
