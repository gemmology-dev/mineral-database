cdl: monoclinic[2/m]:{110}@1.0 + {010}@0.7 + {100}@0.5 + {011}@0.4
system: monoclinic
point_group: 2/m
chemistry: Cu2(CO3)(OH)2
hardness: 3.5-4
description: >
  Copper carbonate hydroxide mineral displaying vivid green color and
  characteristic banded patterns when cut and polished. Well-formed
  prismatic crystals are extremely rare - malachite typically occurs in
  botryoidal, stalactitic, or banded massive forms. The banding results
  from variations in growth conditions creating alternating light and
  dark green layers. Historically important as a copper ore and ornamental stone.
