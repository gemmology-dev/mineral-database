  form_description: 'Copper carbonate hydroxide mineral displaying vivid green color and characteristic
    banded patterns when cut and polished. Well-formed prismatic crystals are extremely rare - malachite
    typically occurs in botryoidal, stalactitic, or banded massive forms. The banding results from variations
    in growth conditions creating alternating light and dark green layers. Historically important as a
    copper ore and ornamental stone.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - botryoidal masses
  - banded masses
  note: Reacts with dilute HCl (effervescence); often found with azurite; crystal specimens rare and valuable
