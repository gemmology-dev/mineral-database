description: >
  Two quartz crystals joined at an angle of 84 degrees 33 minutes, forming a
  distinctive heart or V-shaped habit. Japan Law twins are contact twins with
  composition plane {11-22}. Named for classic specimens from Yamanashi
  Prefecture, Japan. Highly prized by mineral collectors for their geometric
  beauty and relative rarity.
