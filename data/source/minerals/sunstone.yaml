name: Sunstone
cdl: triclinic[-1]:{010}@1.0 + {100}@0.9 + {001}@0.7 + {110}@0.5
system: triclinic
point_group: '-1'
chemistry: (Na,Ca)(Al,Si)4O8
hardness: 6-6.5
description: >
  Plagioclase feldspar displaying aventurescence - a glittery, metallic reflection
  from included reflective platelets. Oregon sunstone is unique in containing
  copper platelets rather than the hematite or goethite found in other sources.
  Oregon material can also show strong dichroism and occur in transparent
  gem-quality crystals. Some specimens display bicolour or tricolour zoning.

notes: >
  Oregon sunstone is the only source of copper-bearing feldspar. The copper
  creates unique optical effects including strong aventurescence, red body
  colour, and occasionally red-green dichroism. Non-Oregon sunstones contain
  hematite or goethite. Feldspar's perfect cleavage requires careful cutting
  and protective settings.
