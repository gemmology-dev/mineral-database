description: >
  Lead molybdate mineral forming characteristically thin, tabular, square
  crystals with brilliant orange to red colors and adamantine lustre. The
  thin crystal habit and exceptional color saturation make wulfenite one
  of the most prized collector minerals. Crystals from the Red Cloud Mine
  in Arizona are particularly famous for their vivid red color.
