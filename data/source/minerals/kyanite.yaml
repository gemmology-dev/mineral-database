name: Kyanite
cdl: triclinic[-1]:{100}@1.0 + {010}@0.4 + {001}@1.5 + {110}@0.6
system: triclinic
point_group: '-1'
chemistry: Al2SiO5
hardness: 4-7 (variable)
description: >
  Aluminum silicate polymorph (with andalusite and sillimanite) famous for
  its extreme directional hardness variation - hardness 4-5 parallel to the
  c-axis but 6-7 perpendicular to it. This anisotropy makes kyanite
  challenging to cut but is diagnostic. The classic blue color derives from
  iron and titanium, though green, orange, and colorless varieties exist.
  Often color-zoned.
