  form_description: 'Aluminum silicate polymorph (with andalusite and sillimanite) famous for its extreme
    directional hardness variation - hardness 4-5 parallel to the c-axis but 6-7 perpendicular to it.
    This anisotropy makes kyanite challenging to cut but is diagnostic. The classic blue color derives
    from iron and titanium, though green, orange, and colorless varieties exist. Often color-zoned.

    '
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - bladed crystals
  note: Diagnostic variable hardness; often contains color zoning; parting on {001}; good toughness despite
    cleavage
