name: Magnetite
cdl: cubic[m3m]:{111}
system: cubic
point_group: m3m
chemistry: Fe3O4
hardness: 5.5-6.5
description: >
  Strongly magnetic iron oxide mineral forming perfect octahedral crystals.
  One of the most magnetic of all naturally-occurring minerals on Earth.
  Magnetite is opaque with a metallic to sub-metallic lustre and is the
  primary ore of iron. Its strong magnetism is diagnostic - crystals will
  attract iron filings and deflect a compass needle.
