  form_description: 'Strongly magnetic iron oxide mineral forming perfect octahedral crystals. One of
    the most magnetic of all naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Magnetite is opaque with a metallic
    to sub-metallic lustre and is the primary ore of iron. Its strong magnetism is diagnostic - crystals
    will attract iron filings and deflect a compass needle.

    '
  forms:
  - octahedron
  - dodecahedron
  note: Opaque mineral - RI not measurable with standard equipment; strongly magnetic
