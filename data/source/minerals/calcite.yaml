  form_description: Dogtooth spar - pointed scalenohedral crystals resembling canine teeth
  forms:
  - scalenohedron
  note: Also called dogtooth spar; scalenohedron has 12 scalene triangle faces
- slug: rhomb
  name: Rhombohedron

  form_description: Perfect rhombohedral cleavage form - Iceland spar is classic example
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  note: Extreme birefringence (0.172) causes dramatic double refraction - discovered by Bartholin in 1669
