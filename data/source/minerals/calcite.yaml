  cdl: |
    #! Species: Calcite
    #! System: Trigonal (-3m)
    #! Habit: Dogtooth spar (scalenohedron)
    trigonal[-3m]:{21-31}
  is_primary: true
  form_description: Dogtooth spar — pointed scalenohedral crystals resembling canine teeth
  forms:
  - scalenohedron
  note: Also called dogtooth spar; scalenohedron has 12 scalene triangle faces
- slug: rhomb
  name: Rhombohedron
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Calcite
    #! System: Trigonal (-3m)
    #! Habit: Rhombohedral cleavage form (Iceland spar)
    trigonal[-3m]:{10-11}
  form_description: Perfect rhombohedral cleavage form — Iceland spar is the classic example
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  note: Extreme birefringence (0.172) causes dramatic double refraction — discovered by Bartholin in 1669
- slug: nailhead
  name: Nailhead
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Calcite
    #! System: Trigonal (-3m)
    #! Habit: Nailhead spar (tabular with basal pinacoid)
    trigonal[-3m]:{0001}@1.0 + {10-11}@0.4
  form_description: Nailhead spar — dominant basal pinacoid with small rhombohedral termination
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - rhombohedron
  note: Flat tabular habit resembles nail head; often found in limestone cavities
- slug: stacked
  name: Stacked Parallel Growth
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Calcite
    #! System: Trigonal (-3m)
    #! Habit: Parallel aggregate of 3 rhombohedra
    trigonal[-3m]:rhombohedron ~ parallel[3]
  form_description: 'Parallel growth aggregate of calcite rhombohedra — multiple crystals grown in
    near-perfect alignment, creating a stepped or stacked appearance. Common in cave environments
    where steady, slow growth conditions favour epitaxial nucleation.'
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  - parallel
  note: Aggregate parallel growth; common in stalactitic environments
