  form_description: 'The green chromium-bearing variety of spodumene, named after William Earl Hidden
    who discovered it in North Carolina. True hiddenite derives its color from chromium and is extremely
    rare, with the finest material coming from the type locality in Alexander County, North Carolina.
    Distinguished from similar-looking stones by its strong pleochroism and perfect cleavage.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  note: True Cr-colored hiddenite is extremely rare and valuable; many stones sold as hiddenite are lighter
    colored or V-bearing
