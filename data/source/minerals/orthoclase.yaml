description: >
  Potassium feldspar (K-feldspar) forming prismatic monoclinic crystals,
  often in granite and pegmatite. The name refers to the nearly 90-degree
  cleavage angle (Greek "orthos" = right, "klasis" = breaking). Orthoclase
  is the host mineral for moonstone (with albite exsolution) and includes
  the transparent yellow variety known as noble orthoclase.
