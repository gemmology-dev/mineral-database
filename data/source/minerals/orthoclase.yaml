  form_description: 'Potassium feldspar (K-feldspar) forming prismatic monoclinic crystals, often in granite
    and pegmatite. The name refers to the nearly 90-degree cleavage angle (Greek "orthos" = right, "klasis"
    = breaking). Orthoclase is the host mineral for moonstone (with albite exsolution) and includes the
    transparent yellow variety known as noble orthoclase.

  form_description: 'Penetration twin with the c-axis as twin axis, creating an apparent symmetrical crystal
    from two interpenetrating monoclinic individuals. Named for Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) in the Czech Republic
    where classic examples occur. Carlsbad twins are very common in granite and related igneous rocks.
    The twin boundary is often visible as a diagonal plane.
