name: Scheelite
cdl: tetragonal[4/m]:{112}@1.0 + {011}@0.7 + {001}@0.4
system: tetragonal
point_group: 4/m
chemistry: CaWO4
hardness: 4.5-5
description: >
  Calcium tungstate mineral known for its brilliant blue-white fluorescence
  under shortwave UV light - one of the most spectacular fluorescent
  minerals. Scheelite forms dipyramidal crystals with high lustre approaching
  diamond. While occasionally faceted for collectors, its softness and
  distinct cleavage make it unsuitable for jewelry wear.
