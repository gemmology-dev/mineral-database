  form_description: 'Calcium tungstate mineral known for its brilliant blue-white fluorescence under shortwave
    UV light - one of the most spectacular fluorescent minerals. Scheelite forms dipyramidal crystals
    with high lustre approaching diamond. While occasionally faceted for collectors, its softness and
    distinct cleavage make it unsuitable for jewelry wear.

  forms:
  - dipyramid
  - pinacoid
  - pseudo-octahedral
  note: Trace molybdenum shifts fluorescence to yellowish-green; important tungsten ore
