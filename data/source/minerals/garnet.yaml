description: >
  Garnet is a group of silicate minerals sharing a common crystal structure
  but varying in chemical composition. The group produces gems in virtually
  every colour except true blue, from common red almandine to rare and valuable
  demantoid. Most gem garnets are solid solutions between end-member compositions.
  The group divides into pyralspite (Al garnets) and ugrandite (Ca garnets) series.

notes: >
  Garnets are singly refractive (isotropic) but commonly show anomalous
  double refraction (ADR) due to internal strain. This appears as patchy
  light/dark patterns under polariscope. ADR is particularly common in
  almandine and is not a sign of misidentification.
