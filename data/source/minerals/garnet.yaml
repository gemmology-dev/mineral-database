  form_description: 'Garnet is a group of silicate minerals sharing a common crystal structure but varying
    in chemical composition. The group produces gems in virtually every colour except true blue, from
    common red almandine to rare and valuable demantoid. Most gem garnets are solid solutions between
    end-member compositions. The group divides into pyralspite (Al garnets) and ugrandite (Ca garnets)
    series.

    cubic[m3m]:{110}[striation:curved]
  form_description: 'Pure rhombic dodecahedral habit - the most common crystal form for garnets. The dodecahedron
    {110} displays twelve rhomb-shaped faces meeting at identical angles. This habit is particularly common
    in almandine and pyrope garnets, often showing slightly curved face striations.

  form_description: 'Trapezohedron (icositetrahedron) habit displaying 24 kite-shaped faces. This form
    {211} is more commonly seen in grossular and andradite garnets than in the pyralspite series. Often
    occurs in combination with dodecahedral faces in natural specimens. Classic examples from Alpine localities
    and Italian grossulars.
