  form_description: 'Arsenic trisulfide mineral with a bright lemon-yellow to golden-orange color and
    pearly lustre on cleavage surfaces. The name derives from Latin "auripigmentum" (gold pigment) - orpiment
    was used historically as a yellow pigment despite its toxicity. Perfect cleavage produces thin, flexible
    but inelastic sheets. Often found with realgar.

  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - foliated masses
  note: CAUTION - contains arsenic; extremely high birefringence; handle with care; wash hands after handling
