  name: Watermelon
  cdl: trigonal[32]:{10-10}@1.0 + {10-11}@0.8 | elongate(c:1.5) | [colour_zone:pink-green]
  form_description: 'Bi-colored tourmaline variety displaying a pink core surrounded by a green rim (or
    occasionally the reverse), resembling a watermelon slice in cross- section. The color zoning results
    from compositional changes during crystal growth, typically involving variations in manganese and
    iron content. Prized for slices cut perpendicular to the c-axis showing the characteristic zoning.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - dipyramid
  note: Best displayed as polished slices cut perpendicular to the c-axis
