name: Aragonite
cdl: orthorhombic[mmm]:{110}@1.0 + {010}@0.7 + {011}@0.6 + {021}@0.4
system: orthorhombic
point_group: mmm
chemistry: CaCO3
hardness: 3.5-4
description: >
  Calcium carbonate polymorph forming orthorhombic crystals - the less stable
  but higher-pressure form compared to trigonal calcite. Pseudohexagonal
  cyclic twins are extremely common, creating apparently hexagonal crystals.
  Aragonite is the primary constituent of nacre (mother-of-pearl) in mollusks
  and forms the skeleton of coral. Converts to calcite when heated to 400C.
localities:
  - Spain (Aragon - type locality)
  - Morocco (spectacular twins)
  - Namibia (blue)
  - Mexico
  - USA (various)
  - Worldwide in caves and hot springs
forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - pseudohexagonal twins
colors:
  - Colorless
  - White
  - Blue
  - Yellow
  - Green
  - Brown
  - Orange (flos ferri variety)
sg: 2.93-2.95
ri: 1.530-1.685
birefringence: 0.155
optical_character: Biaxial -
pleochroism: None
lustre: Vitreous to resinous
cleavage: Good {010}, poor {110} and {011}
fracture: Subconchoidal to splintery
note: Extremely high birefringence; dissolves in dilute HCl with effervescence; forms nacre in shells
