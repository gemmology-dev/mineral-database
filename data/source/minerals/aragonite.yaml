  form_description: 'Calcium carbonate polymorph forming orthorhombic crystals - the less stable but higher-pressure
    form compared to trigonal calcite. Pseudohexagonal cyclic twins are extremely common, creating apparently
    hexagonal crystals. Aragonite is the primary constituent of nacre (mother-of-pearl) in mollusks and
    forms the skeleton of coral. Converts to calcite when heated to 400C.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - pseudohexagonal twins
  note: Extremely high birefringence; dissolves in dilute HCl with effervescence; forms nacre in shells
