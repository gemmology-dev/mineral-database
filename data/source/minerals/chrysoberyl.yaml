  form_description: Tabular orthorhombic crystals often showing pseudohexagonal trillings - third hardest
    gemstone
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - dipyramid
  note: Pseudohexagonal trillings common due to cyclic twinning; cats-eye chrysoberyl is the finest chatoyant
    gem

  form_description: 'Cyclic pseudohexagonal twin composed of three orthorhombic individuals rotated 120
    degrees to create apparent hexagonal symmetry. Trillings form characteristically flat, hexagonal-looking
    crystals with prominent re-entrant angles at the twin boundaries. This twin habit is extremely common
    in chrysoberyl and helps identify the species.
