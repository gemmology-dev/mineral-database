  form_description: Tabular orthorhombic crystals often showing pseudohexagonal trillings - third hardest
    gemstone
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - dipyramid
  note: Pseudohexagonal trillings common due to cyclic twinning; cats-eye chrysoberyl is the finest chatoyant
    gem

  form_description: 'Chrysoberyl cat''s eye (cymophane) - the finest chatoyant gemstone. A sharp,
    silvery-white band of light moves across the cabochon surface due to dense parallel silk (needle-like
    inclusions). The eye effect requires cutting en cabochon with the needle direction perpendicular to
    the dome apex. Sri Lankan and Brazilian material dominates the market. "Milk and honey" effect - when
    a light source is placed to one side, one half appears milky white and the other honey-yellow - is
    the hallmark of exceptional cat''s eye chrysoberyl.

  note: When the term "cat's eye" is used alone in gemmology, it refers exclusively to chrysoberyl cat's
    eye; all other chatoyant gems must be qualified (e.g., "quartz cat's eye")

  cdl: orthorhombic[mmm]:{1-10}@1.0 + {110}@0.9 + {010}@0.5 + {001}@0.2 | twin(trilling)
  form_description: 'Cyclic pseudohexagonal twin composed of three orthorhombic individuals rotated 120
    degrees to create apparent hexagonal symmetry. Trillings form characteristically flat, hexagonal-looking
    crystals with prominent re-entrant angles at the twin boundaries. This twin habit is extremely common
    in chrysoberyl and helps identify the species.
