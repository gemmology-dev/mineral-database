  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}[etch_pit:square]
  form_description: 'Cubic habit diamond - a less common crystal form typically found in industrial-grade
    diamonds from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cube faces often show characteristic etch patterns
    and growth features. Pure cubic diamonds are rarer than octahedral specimens as gem material.

  name: Macle Twin
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0[trigon:sparse] + {100}@0.3 | twin(spinel_law)
  form_description: 'Flattened triangular twin on {111}, also called "macle" - a spinel-law contact twin
    resulting in a distinctive triangular or slightly heart-shaped outline. Macles are historically significant
    in diamond cutting as their shape and twin plane orientation require specialized sawing techniques.
    Common in South African and Russian deposits.
