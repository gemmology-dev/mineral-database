    #! Habit: Cubic with square etch pits
    cubic[m3m]:{100}[etch_pit:square]
  form_description: 'Cubic habit diamond - a less common crystal form typically found in industrial-grade
    diamonds from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cube faces often show characteristic square etch
    patterns and growth features. Pure cubic diamonds are rarer than octahedral specimens as gem material.'

    #! Species: Diamond
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Octahedron with internal phantom growth
    cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0[phantom:1] + {110}@0.2
  form_description: 'Diamond crystal displaying an internal phantom - a ghost-like outline of an earlier
    growth stage visible within the crystal. The phantom forms when growth temporarily pauses, allowing
    a thin layer of impurities or inclusions to settle on the crystal surface, before growth resumes.
    Phantom diamonds are prized by collectors and can provide insights into the diamond''s growth history
    deep in the Earth''s mantle.'

  name: Nested Phantom (green)

    #! Species: Diamond
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Nested growth — green phantom inside octahedron
    cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0 > {111}@1.0
  form_description: 'Diamond displaying nested growth with an internal phantom octahedron visible within
    the outer crystal. Green phantoms are caused by natural irradiation (exposure to radioactive minerals)
    during a growth hiatus, producing a thin green layer that marks the earlier growth stage.'
  forms:
  - octahedron
  note: Green coloration from natural irradiation during growth hiatus

    #! Habit: Spinel-law contact twin (macle)
    cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0[trigon:sparse] + {100}@0.3 | twin(spinel_law)
  form_description: 'Flattened triangular twin on {111}, also called "macle" - a spinel-law contact twin
    resulting in a distinctive triangular or slightly heart-shaped outline. Macles are historically significant
    in diamond cutting as their shape and twin plane orientation require specialized sawing techniques.
    Common in South African and Russian deposits.'
  forms:
  - octahedron
