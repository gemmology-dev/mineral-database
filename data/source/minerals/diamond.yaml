  forms:
  - octahedron

  name: Cube
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}[etch_pit:square]
  form_description: 'Cubic habit diamond - a less common crystal form typically found in industrial-grade
    diamonds from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cube faces often show characteristic etch patterns
    and growth features. Pure cubic diamonds are rarer than octahedral specimens as gem material.

- slug: phantom
  name: Phantom
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0[phantom:1] + {110}@0.2
  form_description: 'Diamond crystal displaying an internal phantom - a ghost-like outline of an earlier
    growth stage visible within the crystal. The phantom forms when growth temporarily pauses, allowing
    a thin layer of impurities or inclusions to settle on the crystal surface, before growth resumes.
    Phantom diamonds are prized by collectors and can provide insights into the diamond''s growth history
    deep in the Earth''s mantle.

- slug: macle
  name: Macle Twin
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{111}@1.0[trigon:sparse] + {100}@0.3 | twin(spinel_law)
  form_description: 'Flattened triangular twin on {111}, also called "macle" - a spinel-law contact twin
    resulting in a distinctive triangular or slightly heart-shaped outline. Macles are historically significant
    in diamond cutting as their shape and twin plane orientation require specialized sawing techniques.
    Common in South African and Russian deposits.
