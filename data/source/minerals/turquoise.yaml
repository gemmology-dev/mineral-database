  form_description: 'Hydrated copper aluminum phosphate prized for millennia for its distinctive sky-blue
    color. Almost always occurs as cryptocrystalline masses in veins and nodules. Color ranges from sky
    blue (most valued) through greenish-blue to apple-green depending on copper (blue) vs iron (green)
    content. Matrix patterns (host rock veining) are valued in some varieties like spiderweb turquoise.'

  form_description: 'Well-formed triclinic crystals of turquoise are extremely rare. When found, they
    occur as tiny prismatic to tabular crystals rarely exceeding a few millimetres. The vast majority
    of turquoise is cryptocrystalline massive material.'
