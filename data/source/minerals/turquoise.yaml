  form_description: 'Hydrated copper aluminum phosphate prized for millennia for its distinctive sky-blue
    color. Well-formed crystals are extremely rare - turquoise almost always occurs as cryptocrystalline
    masses in veins and nodules. Color ranges from sky blue (most valued) through greenish-blue to apple-green
    depending on copper (blue) vs iron (green) content. Matrix patterns (host rock veining) are valued
    in some varieties like spiderweb turquoise.

  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - cryptocrystalline masses
  note: Most commercial turquoise is stabilized; untreated gem-quality material commands premium prices
