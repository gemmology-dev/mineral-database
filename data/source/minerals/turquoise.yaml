description: >
  Hydrated copper aluminum phosphate prized for millennia for its distinctive
  sky-blue color. Well-formed crystals are extremely rare - turquoise almost
  always occurs as cryptocrystalline masses in veins and nodules. Color ranges
  from sky blue (most valued) through greenish-blue to apple-green depending
  on copper (blue) vs iron (green) content. Matrix patterns (host rock veining)
  are valued in some varieties like spiderweb turquoise.
