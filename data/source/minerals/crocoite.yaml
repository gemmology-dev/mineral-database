  form_description: 'Lead chromate mineral forming spectacular elongated prismatic crystals with a vivid
    orange-red to red color. The most highly prized mineral specimens come from Tasmania, Australia, where
    crystals can reach lengths of 10+ cm. Named from Greek "krokos" (saffron) for its color. Despite its
    beauty, crocoite is too soft and fragile for jewelry use.

  forms:
  - prism (elongated)
  - pinacoid
  note: RI over refractometer limit; extremely high birefringence; contains lead - wash hands after handling
