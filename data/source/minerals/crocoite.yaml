description: >
  Lead chromate mineral forming spectacular elongated prismatic crystals
  with a vivid orange-red to red color. The most highly prized mineral
  specimens come from Tasmania, Australia, where crystals can reach
  lengths of 10+ cm. Named from Greek "krokos" (saffron) for its color.
  Despite its beauty, crocoite is too soft and fragile for jewelry use.
