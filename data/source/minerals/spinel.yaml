  form_description: 'Classic spinel law twin forming a flattened triangular habit - the type example for
    this twin law. Contact twinning on {111} produces the characteristic "macle" shape, a flattened octahedron
    appearing nearly triangular in outline. This twin law is named after the mineral spinel and is also
    observed in diamond and franklinite.
