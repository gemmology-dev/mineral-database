description: >
  Classic spinel law twin forming a flattened triangular habit - the type
  example for this twin law. Contact twinning on {111} produces the
  characteristic "macle" shape, a flattened octahedron appearing nearly
  triangular in outline. This twin law is named after the mineral spinel
  and is also observed in diamond and franklinite.
