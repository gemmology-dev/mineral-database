    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Cubic with multicolour zoning
    cubic[m3m]:{100}[colour_zone:multi]
  is_primary: true
  form_description: Perfect cubic habit — defines hardness 4 on Mohs scale
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Fluorite is the mineral that gives its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence
- slug: octahedron
  name: Octahedron
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Octahedral (cleavage form)
    cubic[m3m]:{111}
  form_description: Octahedral habit — also the perfect cleavage form of fluorite
  forms:
  - octahedron
  note: Octahedral crystals parallel the perfect cleavage; cleaved fragments always octahedral
- slug: cuboctahedron
  name: Cuboctahedron
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Cube equally truncated by octahedron
    cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@1.0
  form_description: Cube equally truncated by octahedron — balanced combination form
  forms:
  - cube
  - octahedron
  note: Equal development of cube and octahedron creates 14-faced Archimedean solid
- slug: twin
  name: Penetration Twin
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Interpenetrating twin with cube and octahedron
    cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@0.8 | twin(fluorite)
  form_description: Interpenetrating twin with cube and octahedron faces — complex twin morphology
  forms:
  - cube
  - octahedron
  note: Twin showing both cube and octahedron modification; creates complex geometry
- slug: interpenetrating
  name: Interpenetrating Twin
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Interpenetrating cube twin at 60°
    cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 | twin(fluorite)
  form_description: Two cubes interpenetrating at 60 degree rotation — classic fluorite twin
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Penetration twin with 60 degree rotation around [111] axis; highly prized by collectors
- slug: cluster
  name: Crystal Cluster
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Fluorite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Aggregate cluster of 8 cubes
    cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@0.5 ~ cluster[8]
  form_description: 'Cluster of fluorite crystals growing together — common presentation in mineral
    localities. Multiple cubic or cuboctahedral crystals sharing a matrix, often showing different
    colours in adjacent crystals due to varying trace element concentrations during growth.'
  forms:
  - cube
  - octahedron
  - cluster
  note: Aggregate cluster; fluorite clusters from Derbyshire and China are collector favourites
