fluorescence: Often strong (blue, green, or violet) - source of the term 'fluorescence'
expressions:
- slug: cube
  name: Cube
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}
  is_primary: true
  form_description: Perfect cubic habit - defines hardness 4 on Mohs scale
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Fluorite is the mineral that gives its name to the phenomenon of fluorescence
- slug: octahedron
  name: Octahedron
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{111}
  form_description: Octahedral habit - also the perfect cleavage form of fluorite
  forms:
  - octahedron
  note: Octahedral crystals parallel the perfect cleavage; cleaved fragments always octahedral
- slug: cuboctahedron
  name: Cuboctahedron
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@1.0
  form_description: Cube equally truncated by octahedron - balanced combination form
  forms:
  - cube
  - octahedron
  note: Equal development of cube and octahedron creates 14-faced Archimedean solid
- slug: twin
  name: Penetration Twin
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 + {111}@0.8 | twin(fluorite)
  form_description: Interpenetrating twin with cube and octahedron faces - complex twin morphology
  forms:
  - cube
  - octahedron
  note: Twin showing both cube and octahedron modification; creates complex geometry
- slug: interpenetrating
  name: Interpenetrating Twin
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}@1.0 | twin(fluorite)
  form_description: Two cubes interpenetrating at 60 degree rotation - classic fluorite twin
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Penetration twin with 60 degree rotation around [111] axis; highly prized by collectors
