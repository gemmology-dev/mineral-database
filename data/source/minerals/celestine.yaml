description: >
  Strontium sulfate mineral named for its characteristic celestial blue color
  (from Latin "caelestis" meaning heavenly). Celestine forms beautiful tabular
  to prismatic crystals often found in geodes. It is the primary ore of
  strontium, used in fireworks and flares for its crimson flame color.
  The world-famous celestine geodes from Madagascar can reach enormous sizes.
