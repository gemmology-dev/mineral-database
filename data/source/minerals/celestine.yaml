  form_description: 'Strontium sulfate mineral named for its characteristic celestial blue color (from
    Latin "caelestis" meaning heavenly). Celestine forms beautiful tabular to prismatic crystals often
    found in geodes. It is the primary ore of strontium, used in fireworks and flares for its crimson
    flame color. The world-famous celestine geodes from Madagascar can reach enormous sizes.

    '
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - tabular crystals
  note: Isostructural with barite (BaSO4); distinguished by lower SG and strontium flame test (crimson)
