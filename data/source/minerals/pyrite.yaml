    #! Species: Pyrite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Cubic with parallel striations
    cubic[m3m]:{100}[striation:parallel]
  is_primary: true
  form_description: Cubic habit with characteristic striated faces — the most common sulfide mineral
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Called fool's gold due to superficial resemblance to gold; much lighter (SG 5 vs 19.3) and harder
    than gold
- slug: pyritohedron
  name: Pyritohedron
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Pyrite
    #! System: Cubic (23)
    #! Habit: Pentagonal dodecahedron (pyritohedron)
    cubic[23]:{210}
  form_description: Pentagonal dodecahedron — the form that gives pyrite its name
  forms:
  - pyritohedron
  note: The pyritohedron (pentagonal dodecahedron) is unique to the cubic system with lower symmetry (point
    group 23)
  point_group: '23'
- slug: iron-cross
  name: Iron Cross Twin
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Pyrite
    #! System: Cubic (23)
    #! Habit: Iron cross penetration twin
    cubic[23]:{210}@1.0 + {100}@0.3 | twin(iron_cross)
  form_description: Iron cross twin — penetration twin of two pyritohedra at 90 degrees showing cross
    pattern
  forms:
  - pyritohedron
  - cube
  note: Named for cross-shaped pattern visible on twin plane; highly prized by collectors
  point_group: '23'
- slug: cluster
  name: Crystal Cluster
  cdl: |
    #! Species: Pyrite
    #! System: Cubic (m3m)
    #! Habit: Aggregate cluster of 5 cubes
    cubic[m3m]:{100} ~ cluster[5]
  form_description: 'Cluster of pyrite cubes growing together on matrix — a common and attractive
    presentation. The Spanish locality of Navajun (La Rioja) produces exceptional clusters of sharp
    cubic crystals in marl matrix.'
  forms:
  - cube
  - cluster
  note: Aggregate cluster; Navajun (Spain) produces world-famous cubic pyrite clusters
