expressions:
- slug: cube
  name: Cube
  cdl: cubic[m3m]:{100}[striation:parallel]
  is_primary: true
  form_description: Cubic habit with characteristic striated faces - the most common sulfide mineral
  forms:
  - cube
  note: Called fools gold due to superficial resemblance to gold; much lighter (SG 5 vs 19.3) and harder
    than gold
- slug: pyritohedron
  name: Pyritohedron
  cdl: cubic[23]:{210}
  form_description: Pentagonal dodecahedron - the form that gives pyrite its name
  forms:
  - pyritohedron
  note: The pyritohedron (pentagonal dodecahedron) is unique to the cubic system with lower symmetry (point
    group 23)
  point_group: '23'
- slug: iron-cross
  name: Iron Cross Twin
  cdl: cubic[23]:{210}@1.0 + {100}@0.3 | twin(iron_cross)
  form_description: Iron cross twin - penetration twin of two pyritohedra at 90 degrees showing cross
    pattern
  forms:
  - pyritohedron
  - cube
  note: Named for cross-shaped pattern visible on twin plane; highly prized by collectors
  point_group: '23'
