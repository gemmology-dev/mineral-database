  form_description: 'Arsenic sulfide mineral with a distinctive red to orange-red color, also known as
    "ruby sulfur." Realgar forms striking prismatic crystals often striated parallel to the c-axis. It
    is light-sensitive and gradually degrades to yellow pararealgar powder upon prolonged exposure to
    light. Museum specimens must be stored in darkness. Contains arsenic - handle with care.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - striated crystals
  note: CAUTION - contains arsenic; degrades to pararealgar in light; store in darkness; wash hands after
    handling
