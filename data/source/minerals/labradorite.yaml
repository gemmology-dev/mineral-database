  form_description: 'Plagioclase feldspar displaying labradorescence - striking plays of colour including
    blue, green, gold, and purple caused by light interference from lamellar twinning. The colours appear
    in patches or broad flashes and are best seen on specific crystal orientations. Finnish labradorite
    showing the full spectral range is marketed as "Spectrolite."
