system: triclinic
point_group: '-1'
chemistry: (Ca,Na)(Al,Si)4O8
hardness: 6-6.5
description: >
  Plagioclase feldspar displaying labradorescence - striking plays of colour
  including blue, green, gold, and purple caused by light interference from
  lamellar twinning. The colours appear in patches or broad flashes and are
  best seen on specific crystal orientations. Finnish labradorite showing
  the full spectral range is marketed as "Spectrolite."

notes: >
  "Spectrolite" is the trade name for Finnish labradorite showing full
  spectral colours - vivid blues, greens, oranges, and purples across the
  entire stone. Regular labradorite typically shows one or two dominant
  colours. "Rainbow moonstone" is actually labradorite, not true orthoclase
  moonstone. Labradorescence is caused by interference from twin lamellae,
  distinct from adularescence. Perfect cleavage makes protective settings
  advisable.
