  form_description: 'Common salt - the naturally occurring mineral form of sodium chloride. Halite forms
    perfect cubic crystals with three directions of cleavage at right angles. Best known for its distinctive
    taste (though taste testing is discouraged). Blue halite, colored by radiation-induced F-centers,
    is particularly prized by collectors.

    '
  forms:
  - cube
  - hopper crystals
  note: Soluble in water; hygroscopic - must be stored in dry conditions; characteristic salty taste
