  is_primary: true
  form_description: Hexagonal prism with rhombohedral terminations - most abundant mineral in Earth's
    crust
  forms:
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
- slug: short
  name: Short Prism
  cdl: trigonal[32]:{10-10}@0.4 + {10-11}@1.2 + {01-11}@1.0
  form_description: Short prismatic quartz with prominent terminations - common habit in many localities
  forms:
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
  note: Habit variant with shorter c-axis development relative to rhombohedral faces
- slug: scepter
  name: Scepter
  cdl: trigonal[32]:{10-11}@1.0 + {01-11}@0.9 + {10-10}@0.3 + {0001}@0.2 | elongate(c:0.8) | [phantom:2]
  form_description: Overgrowth habit with enlarged head on thin stem - formed by two-stage crystal growth
  forms:
  - rhombohedron
  - prism
  note: True scepter morphology requires two crystal generations; often prized by collectors
- slug: faden

  form_description: Tabular crystals with characteristic white thread-like inclusion (faden = thread in
    German)
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
  note: Faden formed by repeated fracturing and healing during tectonic activity; thread marks original
    fracture plane

  form_description: 'Two quartz crystals joined at an angle of 84 degrees 33 minutes, forming a distinctive
    heart or V-shaped habit. Japan Law twins are contact twins with composition plane {11-22}. Named for
    classic specimens from Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. Highly prized by mineral collectors for their
    geometric beauty and relative rarity.

- slug: dauphine-twin
  name: Dauphine Twin
  cdl: trigonal[32]:{10-10}@0.5 + {10-11}@1.2 + {01-11}@1.0 + {0001}@2.0 | elongate(c:2.0) | twin(dauphine)
  form_description: 'Penetration twin with 180 degree rotation about the c-axis (trigonal axis). Dauphine
    twinning involves interpenetration of two right-handed or two left-handed quartz individuals, resulting
    in domains with opposite orientation of prism faces. Often detectable only under polarized light or
    by etching. Named for the Dauphine region of France.

- slug: brazil-twin
  name: Brazil Law Twin
  cdl: trigonal[32]:{10-10}@0.5 + {10-11}@1.2 + {01-11}@1.0 + {0001}@2.0 | elongate(c:2.0) | twin(brazil)
  form_description: 'Optical twinning involving interpenetration of left-handed and right-handed quartz
    individuals - essentially a mirror twin. Brazil Law twins show opposite optical rotation in alternating
    domains, detectable with polarized light as sectors of different optical handedness. Not visible externally
    but affects optical properties significantly. Common in natural quartz.
