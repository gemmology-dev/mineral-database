  form_description: 'Scepter quartz with nested overgrowth — an enlarged termination growing on a thinner
    stem crystal. Formed by two-stage crystal growth where conditions changed between growth episodes.
    Prized by collectors for their distinctive morphology.'
  forms:
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
  note: True scepter morphology requires two crystal generations; modelled as nested growth (>)

  form_description: 'Quartz crystal containing visible phantom outlines — ghost-like images of earlier
    growth stages within the crystal. Each phantom records a pause in crystal growth followed by resumption.
    Phantoms may appear as green (chlorite), red (hematite), white (clay), or smoky outlines depending
    on the mineral that settled on the crystal surface during the growth interruption.'
  forms:
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
  note: Modelled as nested growth; chlorite phantoms (green) are most sought after by collectors

  form_description: 'Penetration twin with 180 degree rotation about the c-axis. Dauphine twinning involves
    interpenetration of two right-handed or two left-handed quartz individuals, resulting in domains with
    opposite orientation of prism faces. Often detectable only under polarized light or by etching.'

  form_description: 'Optical twinning involving interpenetration of left-handed and right-handed quartz
    individuals — essentially a mirror twin. Shows opposite optical rotation in alternating domains,
    detectable with polarized light. Not visible externally but affects optical properties significantly.'

  form_description: 'Cluster of multiple quartz crystals growing from a common base — the most common
    presentation of quartz in nature. Crystal clusters form when multiple nucleation points develop
    on a substrate, producing a group of sub-parallel to randomly oriented crystals.'
  forms:
  - prism
  - rhombohedron
  - cluster
  note: Aggregate of 12 individual crystals; common in geodes and hydrothermal veins

  form_description: 'Amethyst geode interior lined with drusy crystals — a cavity in volcanic rock lined
    with inward-pointing amethyst crystals. Brazilian and Uruguayan geodes can reach several metres in
    diameter. The purple colour comes from iron impurities and natural irradiation.'
