name: Moonstone
cdl: monoclinic[2/m]:{010}@1.0 + {110}@0.8 + {001}@0.7 + {100}@0.5
system: monoclinic
point_group: 2/m
chemistry: KAlSi3O8
hardness: 6-6.5
description: >
  Feldspar variety displaying adularescence - a soft, billowy glow that appears
  to float just below the surface. The effect is caused by light scattering from
  alternating layers of orthoclase and albite that form during cooling (exsolution).
  Layer thickness determines the colour of the schiller: thin layers (~0.1 microns)
  produce blue; thicker layers produce white. Fine blue moonstone commands
  significant premiums.

species: Orthoclase/Albite
notes: >
  Fine blue moonstone with strong adularescence and good transparency
  commands significant premiums. The blue schiller should appear to float
  within the stone, moving as the gem is tilted. "Rainbow moonstone" is
  actually labradorite showing multicoloured flashes, not true orthoclase
  moonstone. Feldspar's perfect cleavage makes it vulnerable to chipping;
  protective settings recommended.
