  form_description: 'Feldspar variety displaying adularescence - a soft, billowy glow that appears to
    float just below the surface. The effect is caused by light scattering from alternating layers of
    orthoclase and albite that form during cooling (exsolution). Layer thickness determines the colour
    of the schiller: thin layers (~0.1 microns) produce blue; thicker layers produce white. Fine blue
    moonstone commands significant premiums.
