  form_description: 'The primary blue component of lapis lazuli, lazurite is a sulfur-containing feldspathoid
    mineral. Well-formed dodecahedral crystals are extremely rare - lazurite typically occurs as massive
    aggregates within lapis lazuli rock along with pyrite, calcite, and other minerals. The intense blue
    color results from sulfur radical anions (S3-) trapped in the crystal structure.

    '
  forms:
  - dodecahedron
  - cube
  note: Well-crystallized specimens uncommon; usually occurs massive in lapis lazuli rock
