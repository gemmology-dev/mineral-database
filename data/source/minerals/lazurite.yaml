  form_description: 'The primary blue component of lapis lazuli, lazurite is a sulfur-containing feldspathoid
    mineral. Almost always occurs as massive aggregates within lapis lazuli rock along with pyrite, calcite,
    and other minerals. The intense blue color results from sulfur radical anions (S3-) trapped in the
    crystal structure.'
  forms:
  - massive

  is_primary: false
  form_description: 'Well-formed dodecahedral crystals of lazurite are extremely rare. When found, they
    show rhombic dodecahedron habit with minor cube. Crystal specimens are highly prized by collectors
    and come primarily from the Badakhshan mines in Afghanistan.'
  forms:
  - dodecahedron
  - cube
  note: Well-crystallized specimens extremely rare; usually occurs massive in lapis lazuli rock
