description: >
  The primary blue component of lapis lazuli, lazurite is a sulfur-containing
  feldspathoid mineral. Well-formed dodecahedral crystals are extremely rare -
  lazurite typically occurs as massive aggregates within lapis lazuli rock
  along with pyrite, calcite, and other minerals. The intense blue color
  results from sulfur radical anions (S3-) trapped in the crystal structure.
