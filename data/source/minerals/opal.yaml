  form_description: 'AMORPHOUS hydrated silica (mineraloid) - technically not a mineral but a mineraloid
    due to its lack of crystalline structure. Precious opal displays "play of color" - spectral flashes
    caused by diffraction of light from ordered arrays of silica spheres. The sphere size determines which
    colors appear. Common opal lacks this optical phenomenon. Contains 3-21% water, making it vulnerable
    to crazing in dry conditions.

    '
  forms:
  - amorphous (no crystal faces)
  - nodules
  - veins
  - replacement forms
  note: EDUCATIONAL NOTE - This is a schematic visualization only. Opal has NO true crystal structure;
    it is amorphous.
