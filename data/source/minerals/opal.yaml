  form_description: 'Amorphous hydrated silica (mineraloid) displaying "play of color" - spectral flashes
    caused by diffraction of light from ordered arrays of silica spheres (150-400 nm diameter). The sphere
    size determines which colors appear. Contains 3-21% water, making it vulnerable to crazing in dry
    conditions. Precious opal shows play of color; common opal lacks this optical phenomenon.'
  forms:
  - botryoidal
  - nodules
  - veins
  - replacement forms
  note: Mineraloid — no true crystal structure; play of color from diffraction in ordered silica sphere arrays
