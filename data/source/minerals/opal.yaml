name: Opal
cdl: amorphous[none]:{}
system: amorphous
point_group: none
chemistry: SiO2.nH2O
hardness: 5.5-6.5
description: >
  AMORPHOUS hydrated silica (mineraloid) - technically not a mineral but a
  mineraloid due to its lack of crystalline structure. Precious opal displays
  "play of color" - spectral flashes caused by diffraction of light from
  ordered arrays of silica spheres. The sphere size determines which colors
  appear. Common opal lacks this optical phenomenon. Contains 3-21% water,
  making it vulnerable to crazing in dry conditions.
