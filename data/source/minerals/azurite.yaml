name: Azurite
cdl: monoclinic[2/m]:{001}@1.0 + {110}@0.8 + {100}@0.7 + {011}@0.5 + {111}@0.4
system: monoclinic
point_group: 2/m
chemistry: Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2
hardness: 3.5-4
description: >
  Copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with an intense deep azure blue color
  that has made it prized since antiquity as a pigment (known as "mountain
  blue"). Unlike malachite, azurite forms well-developed prismatic crystals.
  The two minerals often occur together, with azurite commonly altering to
  malachite (pseudomorphs). Crystal specimens from Morocco and Namibia are
  particularly sought after.
localities:
  - Morocco (Touissit, Mibladen - world-class crystals)
  - Namibia (Tsumeb)
  - Arizona (USA - Bisbee, Morenci)
  - Australia
  - France (Chessy - historic "chessylite")
  - Russia
forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - tabular crystals
colors:
  - Azure blue
  - Deep blue
  - Dark blue
  - Light blue

ri: 1.730-1.838
birefringence: 0.108-0.110
optical_character: Biaxial +
pleochroism: Strong (light blue to dark blue shades)
pleochroism_strength: strong
pleochroism_color1: Light blue
pleochroism_color2: Dark blue
pleochroism_notes: Dichroic; distinctive azure blue coloration
lustre: Vitreous (crystals) to earthy (massive)
cleavage: Perfect {011}, fair {100}
fracture: Conchoidal
note: Alters readily to malachite; reacts with dilute HCl; distinguished from lazurite by crystal form and higher SG
