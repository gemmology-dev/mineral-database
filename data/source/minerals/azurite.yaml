  form_description: 'Copper carbonate hydroxide mineral with an intense deep azure blue color that has
    made it prized since antiquity as a pigment (known as "mountain blue"). Unlike malachite, azurite
    forms well-developed prismatic crystals. The two minerals often occur together, with azurite commonly
    altering to malachite (pseudomorphs). Crystal specimens from Morocco and Namibia are particularly
    sought after.

    '
  forms:
  - prism
  - pinacoid
  - tabular crystals
  note: Alters readily to malachite; reacts with dilute HCl; distinguished from lazurite by crystal form
    and higher SG
