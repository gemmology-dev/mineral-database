  form_description: 'Pyrope-almandine intermediate garnet with a distinctive purplish-red to raspberry
    colour. The composition is approximately 70% pyrope and 30% almandine. Popular for its attractive
    lighter red-purple colour that distinguishes it from darker almandine. Name derived from Greek "rhodon"
    (rose) for its rose-like colour.
