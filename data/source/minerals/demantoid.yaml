description: >
  Green variety of andradite garnet, known as the "king of garnets" for its
  exceptional brilliance and fire. Coloured by chromium, demantoid has dispersion
  (0.057) higher than diamond. Russian Ural material with "horsetail" inclusions
  is most prized, with these inclusions actually adding value - unusual in
  the gem world. Fine stones over 1 carat are rare; over 3 carats exceptionally so.

notes: >
  Horsetail inclusions are diagnostic for Russian (Ural) origin and add
  significant value. The very high RI (1.888) is distinctive among garnets
  and most gemstones. Non-Russian demantoid typically lacks horsetails.
