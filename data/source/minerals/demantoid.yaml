  form_description: 'Green variety of andradite garnet, known as the "king of garnets" for its exceptional
    brilliance and fire. Coloured by chromium, demantoid has dispersion (0.057) higher than diamond. Russian
    Ural material with "horsetail" inclusions is most prized, with these inclusions actually adding value
    - unusual in the gem world. Fine stones over 1 carat are rare; over 3 carats exceptionally so.
