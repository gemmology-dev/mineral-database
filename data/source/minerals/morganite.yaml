  form_description: 'Pink to peach variety of beryl, coloured by manganese (Mn2+/Mn3+). Increasingly popular
    in fine jewellery, morganite offers excellent clarity and is available in larger sizes than many other
    coloured gems. Often heat-treated to remove yellow tones and enhance the pink colour.
