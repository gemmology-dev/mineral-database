  form_description: 'Green to blue-green variety of microcline feldspar, named after the Amazon River
    though not actually found there. The distinctive color was long thought to result from copper, but
    is now attributed to lead and water in the crystal structure creating color centers. Often displays
    characteristic white streaks from perthitic albite intergrowths. Popular as a decorative stone and
    in jewelry.

    '
  forms:
  - pinacoid
  - prism
  - Baveno twins (common)
  note: Color from Pb+H2O color centers, not copper; often perthitic with white albite streaks
