description: >
  Green to blue-green variety of microcline feldspar, named after the Amazon
  River though not actually found there. The distinctive color was long
  thought to result from copper, but is now attributed to lead and water in
  the crystal structure creating color centers. Often displays characteristic
  white streaks from perthitic albite intergrowths. Popular as a decorative
  stone and in jewelry.
