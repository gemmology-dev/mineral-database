  form_description: 'Beryllium aluminium silicate that produces several important gem varieties including
    emerald, aquamarine, morganite, heliodor, goshenite, and red beryl. Despite sharing the same basic
    chemistry and structure, beryl varieties differ dramatically in value based on colour, clarity, and
    origin. Typically forms hexagonal prismatic crystals.

  form_description: 'Tabular habit variant of beryl with dominant basal pinacoid giving a flat, plate-like
    appearance. This habit is less common than the typical elongated prismatic form. Often seen in morganite
    and some emerald crystals from specific localities.
