description: >
  Beryllium aluminium silicate that produces several important gem varieties
  including emerald, aquamarine, morganite, heliodor, goshenite, and red beryl.
  Despite sharing the same basic chemistry and structure, beryl varieties differ
  dramatically in value based on colour, clarity, and origin. Typically forms
  hexagonal prismatic crystals.
